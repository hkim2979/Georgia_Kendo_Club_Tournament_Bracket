# Georgia_Kendo_Club_Tournament_Bracket
 <p>The Georgia Kendo Club is an amateur sports team that specializes in Japanese martial arts. I have created a tournament bracket using Java JFrame as requested by the GKC president. The bracket displays rounds of 4, 8, and 16 competitors. It allows for the input of names in each category and provides the functionality to save the bracket as a JPG file for record-keeping.</p>
